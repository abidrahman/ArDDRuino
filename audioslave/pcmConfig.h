/*
This library was intended to be a simple and user friendly wav audio player using standard
Arduino libraries, playing bare-bones standard format WAV files.

Many of the extra features have been added due to user request, and are enabled
optionally only to preserve the out of the box simplicity and performance initially
intended.
